# Face-Mask-Detection
The Face Mask Detection project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) CNN, a deep learning technique, employed to process and analyze images, specifically focusing on identifying individuals who are not wearing face masks. By training the model on a diverse dataset of masked and unmasked faces, it can accurately detect and classify mask usage in real-time.
